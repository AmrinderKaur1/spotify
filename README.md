# spotify
python automation project to add songs in spotify playlist.
We use bs4 module to scrape the billboard's top song at a specific date and spotipy api to make an api call to spotify for the user whose credentials are used. This call then creates a playlist and adds the song into it.
Hence we automated the process of creating a spotify playlist and adding a song into it.
